# Rust Basic Blockchain Project

This project demonstrates a basic blockvhain project that implements basic blockchain concepts, such as hashes, smart contracts, genesis nodes, and chain validation.

To start the server, enter the following into your terminal (ensure you have cargo and Rust downlaoded). For peer to peer connection, it is best to open two seperate terminal instances.

* `RUST_LOG=info cargo run`

List of commands:

* `ls p` - lists all peer clients
* `ls c` - prints the local blockchain
* `create b $data` - creates a new block in the chain with value $data, which is of type String
